  "content": "The **Pythagorean Theorem** is a fundamental theorem in geometry that describes the relationship between the three sides of a **right triangle**. The details are as follows:\n\n---\n\n### **Theorem Statement**\nIn a right triangle, the square of the **hypotenuse** (the side opposite the right angle) equals the sum of the squares of the two **legs** (the two sides that form the right angle).  \nExpressed as a formula:  \n\\[\n\\boxed{a^2 + b^2 = c^2}\n\\]  \nWhere:\n- \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are the two legs of the right triangle,\n- \\(c\\) is the hypotenuse.\n\n---\n\n### **Geometric Meaning**\nThe Pythagorean Theorem reveals the quantitative relationship between the three sides of a right triangle. For example:\n- If the lengths of the two legs are known, the hypotenuse can be found: \\(c = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\\).\n- If the hypotenuse and one leg are known, the other leg can be found: \\(a = \\sqrt{c^2 - b^2}\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Historical Background**\n- The theorem was first proven by the ancient Greek mathematician **Pythagoras** and his school, hence the name.\n- However, related discoveries were made as early as over 1000 BC in ancient Babylon and ancient China (as recorded in \"Zhou Bi Suan Jing\" with the \"3-4-5\" triangle).\n\n---\n\n### **Applications**\n1. **Measurement Problems**: Calculating distances, heights, etc. (such as measuring the height of a flagpole).\n2. **Engineering and Architecture**: Ensuring the accuracy of right-angle structures.\n3. **Mathematical Extensions**: It is the foundation of trigonometry, vectors, and analytic geometry.\n\n---\n\n### **Example**\nIf the two legs of a right triangle are 3 and 4, then the hypotenuse is:  \n\\[\nc = \\sqrt{3^2 + 4^2} = \\sqrt{9 + 16} = \\sqrt{25} = 5\n\\]  \n(This is the classic \"3-4-5\" triangle).\n\n---\n\nThe Pythagorean Theorem is one of the most widely applied theorems in mathematics, demonstrating the deep connection between geometry and algebra.",
